# KotlinApp
example of my application that I created during a Kotlin course


Requires Android Studio to work!


1. Download this repository, and open "KotlinApp"-file in your Android studio
2. set up yourself an Android emulator (preferably with "Google Play"-store support)
3. press run-button, if it doesn't work in the basic app then you have to continue path to
    KotlinApp\app\src\main\java\com\example\kotlinapp\FireBaseSetUp.kt
and then try running it again.
4. The app is running and it should look something like this:

5.Register or Log in with following credentials:
  Username: test@test.com
  Password: password
  
The following view should look like this:

Tabbing onto the next view looks like this:

From this "Mobile Development Project"-course I got 2/5 as my grade since the visual bug is there.
